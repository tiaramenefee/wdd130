    <p>Hello Everyone!</p>
    <p>I am currently majoring in Information Technology with a minor in Accounting. The reason why I chose Information Technology was because I actually got a job working as an IT Assistant. I suddenly really enjoyed the work that I was doing so I decided to purse a degree in Information Technology. As I have gain some knowledge in the Information Technology world, I have learned that this is a career where I continuely be learning. I am someone who needs to be able to learn something new or I get bored very quickly!</p>
    <p>Some of my favorite things to do is reading, cooking/baking, and anything outdoors. Right now (since its winter), I really enjoy skiing. My husband and I get Grand Targhee ski passes every year so we make sure we go every weekend. I really love Grand Targhee because that is where I have made some of my most memoriable moments!</p>
    <p>As mention aboved I do have a husband. My husband's name is Joseph Maddox. We have been married for two years now. We met our senior year of high school and have been together ever since.</p>
    <p>I have been a memeber of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints since I was 20 years old. I am now 22 years old so its only been two years. I am really happy that I joined the Church and that my husband baptized me! I am super grateful!</p>
    <p>I am looking forward to learning a lot in this class especially the programming side. I think this is going to be a lot of fun!</p>
