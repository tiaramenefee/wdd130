            <h2>How many people can be on the raft at once?</h2>
            <h3> Typically, the number of people that can fit on a raft depends of the weight and size of the rafts. Our rafts come in many differnt sizes and can vary between the weight. Most of our rafts can hold about five to seven people. We do have some rafts that hold ten people at most. When it comes to the ten person raft, we typically like to have an advanced booking on this raft.  </h3>

            <h2> What equipment is needed for rafting?</h2>
            <h3> Here are some essensial equipment needed to ensure safety and comfort. Raft is the most important item of course. The raft is specifice to the size of group and the type of water we will be floating in. The next one would be paddles. The paddles help navigate the water and keep the raft moving in the right direction. Life jackets are always to be worn when we are in water. Helments are essential for protection from any head injuries. Wetsuits and footwear are needed to be worn. Throw ropes will always be apart of a journey just in case someone comes out of our raft we can pull them to safety. Lastly, a first-aid kit. It is super essential for treating any injuries that may happen during our trip!</h3>
